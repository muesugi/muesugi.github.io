The included documentation page shows even non-technical audiences how to easily transfer crochet patterns, with only a few extra keystrokes, into the live editor. <br> <br> As a crocheter myself, I found that written crochet patterns and code were quite similar, but because not many people are involved in both worlds, very few, if any, tools exist to help pattern designers and crocheters who currently follow these patterns almost blindly.", "http://goo.gl/SkcZgP");

Seeing that many crocheters only know how to read charts or patterns, not both, I decided to create a way for these hobbyist crocheters to switch from one to the other (Textify, the chart to pattern generator, is still underway). In addition, upon understanding the wide diversity of patterns, I decided to create a 3D, navigable visualization application using THREE.js for the project visualization (Visualizer). <br> <br> By coming back to this project almost three years later, I hope to create a more reliable, accurate, and stable tool. The abstraction, which, looking back, was sorely missed in String, allows for a more accurate display and pattern measurement (coming soon!), as well as scalability for future development of the infinitely many different stitch types that exist well loved by the crochet world.", "");
